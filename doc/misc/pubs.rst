Publications using fwdpy11
======================================================================

This is a bit of a cheat, but the following publications used fwdpy_, which was a precursor to fwdpy11 and informed much
of its design:

* `Sanjak et al. (2017) A Model of Compound Heterozygous, Loss-of-Function Alleles Is Broadly Consistent with
  Observations from Complex-Disease GWAS Datasets <http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006573>`_

Other publications that we are aware of. (Please send us yours!)

* `Zhou et al. (PNAS) Evolutionary genomics of grape (Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera) domestication.
  <http://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/11715.full>`_
* `Schrider and Kern (bioRxiv) Soft sweeps are the dominant mode of adaptation in the human genome.
