  abstract = "Understanding the demographic history of populations is a key
              goal in population genetics, and with improving methods and data,
              ever more complex models are being proposed and tested.
              Demographic models of current interest typically consist of a set
              of discrete populations, their sizes and growth rates, and
              continuous and pulse migrations between those populations over a
              number of epochs, which can require dozens of parameters to fully
              describe. There is currently no standard format to define such
              models, significantly hampering progress in the field. In
              particular, the important task of translating the model
              descriptions in published work into input suitable for population
              genetic simulators is labor intensive and error prone. We propose
              the Demes data model and file format, built on widely used
              technologies, to alleviate these issues. Demes provide a
              well-defined and unambiguous model of populations and their
              properties that is straightforward to implement in software, and
              a text file format that is designed for simplicity and clarity.
              We provide thoroughly tested implementations of Demes parsers in
              multiple languages including Python and C, and showcase initial
              support in several simulators and inference methods. An
              introduction to the file format and a detailed specification are

               General Duality Between Statistics of Genealogies and Genomes",
  author    = "Ralph, Peter and Thornton, Kevin and Kelleher, Jerome",
  abstract  = "As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it
               distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those
               that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree
               relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical
               summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the
               underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a
               general framework that efficiently computes single-site
               population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence
               encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general
               approach accumulates sample weights within the genealogical tree
               at each position on the genome, which are then combined using a
               summary function; different statistics result from different
               choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in three
               ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated as
               usual from genome sequence; by branch, which gives the expected
               value of the dual site statistic under the infinite sites model
               of mutation, and by node, which summarizes the contribution of
               each ancestor to these statistics. We use the framework to
               implement many currently defined statistics of genome sequence
               (making the statistics' relationship to the underlying
               genealogical trees concrete and explicit), as well as the
               corresponding branch statistics of tree shape. We evaluate
               computational performance using simulated data, and show that
               calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general
               framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than
               optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and
               memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality
               between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees
               inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project data set, and discuss

               evolution and demographic history on the genetic makeup of
               populations. Thanks to recent progress in algorithms and data
               structures, simulators such as the widely-used msprime now
               provide genome-wide simulations for millions of individuals.
               However, this software relies on classic coalescent theory and
               its assumptions that sample sizes are small and that the region
               being simulated is short. Here we show that coalescent
               simulations of long regions of the genome exhibit large biases
               in identity-by-descent (IBD), long-range linkage disequilibrium
               (LD), and ancestry patterns, particularly when the sample size
               is large. We present a Wright-Fisher extension to msprime, and

               and ancestry proportions, while also addressing more subtle
               biases of the coalescent. Further, these extensions are more
               computationally efficient than state-of-the-art coalescent
               simulations when simulating long regions, including whole-genome
               data. For shorter regions, efficiency can be maintained via a
               hybrid model which simulates the recent past under the

  author   = "Thornton, Kevin R",
  abstract = "Predictions about the effect of natural selection on patterns of
              linked neutral variation are largely based on models involving
              the rapid fixation of unconditionally beneficial mutations.
              However, when phenotypes adapt to a new optimum trait value, the
              strength of selection on individual mutations decreases as the
              population adapts. Here, I use explicit forward simulations of a
              single trait with additive-effect mutations adapting to an
              ``optimum shift.'' Detectable ``hitchhiking'' patterns are only
              apparent if (i) the optimum shifts are large with respect to
              equilibrium variation for the trait, (ii) mutation rates to
              large-effect mutations are low, and (iii) large-effect mutations
              rapidly increase in frequency and eventually reach fixation,
              which typically occurs after the population reaches the new
              optimum. For the parameters simulated here, partial sweeps do not
              appreciably affect patterns of linked variation, even when the
              mutations are strongly selected. The contribution of new
              mutations vs. standing variation to fixation depends on the
              mutation rate affecting trait values. Given the fixation of a
              strongly selected variant, patterns of hitchhiking are similar on
              average for the two classes of sweeps because sweeps from
              standing variation involving large-effect mutations are rare when
              the optimum shifts. The distribution of effect sizes of new
              mutations has little effect on the time to reach the new optimum,
              but reducing the mutational variance increases the magnitude of
              hitchhiking patterns. In general, populations reach the new
              optimum prior to the completion of any sweeps, and the times to
              fixation are longer for this model than for standard models of
              directional selection. The long fixation times are due to a
              combination of declining selection pressures during adaptation
              and the possibility of interference among weakly selected sites
              for traits with high mutation rates.",

               individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary
               breeding models, population structure and demography. This
               approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of
               tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only
               those loci that may affect reproduction (those having
               non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is
               recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the
               software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be
               quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each
               breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time,
               but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We
               solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly
               'simplify' a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history
               for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the
               history with respect to the extant population, we show that the
               total storage space required is modest and overall large
               efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time
               simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for
               recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used
               to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We
               modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use
               this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large,
               whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In
               addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has
               several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the
               simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes.
               (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can
               be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a
               simulation's entire final generation as well as its history. (3)
               A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient
               coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for

              trait (e.g., heart disease) also affect fitness because the trait
              is a component of fitness or because the mutations have
              pleiotropic effects on fitness. The model predicts that the
              genetic variance, and hence the heritability, in the trait is
              contributed by mutations at low frequency in the population,
              unless the mean strength of selection of mutations that affect
              the trait is very small or weakly selected mutations tend to
              contribute disproportionately to the trait compared with strongly
              selected mutations. Furthermore, it is shown that each rare
              mutation tends to contribute more to the variance than each
              common mutation. These results may explain why most genome-wide
              association studies have failed to find associations that explain
              much of the variance. It is also shown that most of the variance
              in fitness contributed by new nonsynonymous mutations is caused
              by mutations at very low frequency in the population. This
              implies that most low-frequency SNPs, which are observed in
              current resequencing studies of, for example, 100 chromosomes,
              probably have little impact on the variance in fitness or traits.
              Finally, it is shown that the variance contributed by a category
              of mutations (e.g., coding or regulatory) depends largely upon
              the mean strength of selection; this has implications for

              based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within
              and between populations. For candidate models we numerically
              compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to
              the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to
              three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite
              likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the
              variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We
              thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate
              uncertainties for parameters and significance values for
              hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on
              single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected
              alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary
              forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and
              admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the
              settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA
              resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU,
              and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence
              between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years
              ago (95\% confidence interval: 40-270 kya). This is earlier than
              other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration.
              We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence
              time to be 23 kya (95\% c.i.: 17-43 kya), long after
              archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally,

              our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration.
              Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously

              with several loci evolving according to a variety of mutation
              models (from simple to context-dependent), and allows for
              insertions and deletions. Each locus can be annotated as either
              coding or non-coding, sex-linked or autosomal, selected or
              neutral, and have an arbitrary linkage structure (from completely
              linked to independent). AVAILABILITY: The source code (written in
              the C programming language) is available at
              http://sfscode.sourceforge.net, and a web server
              (http://cbsuapps.tc.cornell.edu/sfscode.aspx) allows the user to
              perform simulations using the high-performance computing cluster

  abstract  = "A model of genetic variation in a quantitative trait is
               investigated in which mutations affecting the trait also have
               deleterious pleiotropic effects on fitness, such that there is a
               bivariate distribution of effects of the mutants. It is
               motivated principally by frequent observations of deleterious
               side-effects of visible mutations. When the correlation, $\rho $
               of absolute values of mutant effects on the trait and fitness is
               unity, the model behaves similarly to one of pure stabilizing
               selection on the trait alone, and the genetic variance quickly
               increases to a limit with increasing population size (N).
               Otherwise ($\rho $ < 1), the genetic variance continues to
               increase as N increases, but may do so very slowly because genes
               affecting the metric trait can be nearly neutral with respect to
               fitness and therefore contribute much variance in large
               populations. The model predicts that the metric trait will
               appear to be under stabilizing selection because extreme
               genotypes tend to be less fit, and its apparent strength is
               evaluated.",
