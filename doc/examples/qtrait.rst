Simulating quantitative traits, I
==========================================

Background reading:

* :ref:`definitions`

Further reading:

* :ref:`heritability`

fwdpy11 allows the simulation of quantitative traits in a fairly general way.  These simulations differ from standard
population genetic simulations in that a "trait value" is calculated and that a mapping from trait value to fitness is
required. Optionally, one may want to add "noise" to trait values, perhaps representing non-genetic contributions to
phenotype.

This page covers simulations of quantitative traits in a single genomic region (*e.g.* using
:class:`fwdpy11.DiploidPopulation`).

Let's call our trait value :math:`P`, which is composed of a genetic component, :math:`G` and a random component
:math:`E`.

The evolve function
-----------------------------

The function used to evolve quantitative traits in :func:`fwdpy11.wright_fisher`.

Trait values
-----------------------------

The following trait value functions are implemented:

* :class:`fwdpy11.genetic_values.DiploidAdditive`
* :class:`fwdpy11.genetic_values.DiploidMult`
* :class:`fwdpy11.genetic_values.DiploidGBR`

The above functions calculate the :math:`G` component of :math:`P`.  Custom trait value functions can be written in C++
in a similar manner as for custom fitness functions for standard "popgen" simulations.

Adding noise to trait values
----------------------------------------------------------


Mapping trait values to fitness
----------------------------------------------------------

In order to calulate fitness, we need a Python callable relating trait values to fitness.  In this section, I show the
implementation of two classes included in fwdpy11.

Stabilizing selection with constant parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The first class models Gaussian stabilizing selection ("GSS") with respect to a constant optimum trait value and constant
intensity of selection. Under GSS models, :math:`w=e^{-\frac{(P-O)^2}{2VS}}`, where :math:`P` is the trait value,
:math:`O` is the optimum, and :math:`VS` determines the intensity of selection against deviations from the optimum
(*e.g* selection against variance in trait values). 

This class is rather simple:

* The constructor takes the optimum and :math:`VS` as parameters.
* The call function takes a diploid's trait value and uses the class data to return :math:`w=e^{-\frac{(P-O)^2}{2VS}}`.

Stabilizing selection with a moving optimum
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An example simulation
-----------------------------

The following code block represents the following model:

* There are no neutral mutations
* Mutations affecting trait values are additive and Gaussian distributed.
* Trait values are under Gaussian stabilizing selection with :math:`VS=1`.
* The optimum changes to a new value every :math:`0.1N` generations according to a geometric distribution.  The new optimum value is :math:`N(0,1)`.
* The :math:`E` value for offspring is the parental mean :math:`E` plus a Gaussian deviate.  Thus, there are shared
  environmental effects between parent and offspring that have a mean of zero.
