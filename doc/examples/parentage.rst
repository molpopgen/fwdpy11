Tracking parentage
======================================================================

.. versionadded:: 0.1.4

Background reading:

* :ref:`recorders`

This example shows one way to track parentage during a simulation.  We'll run a single-deme simulation and use
:attr:`fwdpy11.DiploidPopulation.popdata_user` to record the complete pedigree for the population over time.

The mechanics are quite simple.  We define a custom recorder that gathers the parent data
(:attr:`fwdpy11.DiploidMetadata.parents`) into a list each generation.  We will couple the parent
data along with the individual's label field.  This coupling facilitates later post-processing.

For convenience, we coerce the data into a `collections.namedtuple`, which allows final storage into a
`pandas.DataFrame`.

A real-world example would have to do more work than this.  You would probably need to assign unique individual IDs each
generation, etc., and get the data into some standard format (PLINK's ped/fam, for example), in order to do interesting
work with the pedigree.  Additionally, you probably want to thin the data down to remove individuals that left no
offspring, etc.
