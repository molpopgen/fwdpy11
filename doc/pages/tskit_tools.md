    The following are boolean flags that are used to populate
    the ``flags`` colummn of a :class:`tskit.IndividualTable`.
    The flags represent individuals alive at the end of the simulation,
    those preserved as ancient samples, and those from the
    very first generation of the simulation, respectively.
    See :ref:`here <recapitation>` for why the last class
    of preserved samples are special.
