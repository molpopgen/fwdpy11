Conceptual overview of tree sequence recording
--------------------------------------------------------------

fwdpy11 0.2.0 added support for tree sequence recording (TSR), which is a method to both speed up
forward-time simulations and to track the entire genealogical history of the simulation.  The key reference
describing TSR is::

    Kelleher, Jerome, Kevin Thornton, Jaime Ashander, and Peter Ralph. 2018.
    Efficient Pedigree Recording for Fast Population Genetics Simulation.
    bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/248500.

The methods described in the 2018 paper rely heavily on concepts described in the preceding work::

    Kelleher, Jerome, Alison M. Etheridge, and Gilean McVean. 2016.
    Efficient Coalescent Simulation and Genealogical Analysis for Large Sample Sizes.
    PLoS Computational Biology 12 (5): e1004842.

The goal of TSR is to track a set of tables that contain the trees describing the ancestry of the population.

Trees and tables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To start out, let us consider the follwing tree:

.. figure:: ../images/tree.png

        Fig 1: A tree with seven nodes.

This tree is the "marginal" history of a genomic segment covering the half-open interval :math:`[l, r)`. In other words,
all genomic positions in this interval have the same ancestry, and recombination results in different intervals having
different trees.

Following Kelleher *et al.* (2016, PLoS Computational Biology), we can represent the above tree using two tables:

.. figure:: ../images/tables.png

       Fig 2: The node and edges tables corresponding to Fig 1.

We learn two things from Fig 2:

1. Node tables track the birth times of nodes.  Here, we measure time as increasing from past to the present.
2. Edge tables record the transmissions of genomic intervals from parents to children.  The parent/child fields
   are indexes of the node table.

Edge tables have specific sorting requirements.  The sorting is nested:

1. Decreasing order of parent birth times (as we read the table from top to bottom).
2. For edges with the same parent, child indexes are sorted in increasing order
3. Finally, edges are sorted by increasing left position.

Relating an evolving populaton to node and edge tables
==============================================================================

Consider the case of a diploid Wright-Fisher population.  There are :math:`N` individuals, and
thus :math:`2N` haploid genomes.  Define a genome as all of the genomic intervals inherited from a 
single parent.  Positions along the genome have values from the interval :math:`[0,L)`, and we do not
care if positions take on continuous or discrete values within that interval.

At any time point, we may describe the population as consisting of :math:`2N` nodes with integer labels
:math:`[i,i+2N)`.  Our diploids are then defined as adjacent tuples of nodes,
:math:`D \in [(i,i+1),(i+2,i+3),\ldots,(i+2N-2,i+2N-1)]`.  Node labels thus represent haploid genomes.

To generate the next generation, offspring are generated by recording which intervals they inherit from which parental
nodes.  These intervals are determined by the usual rules of evolving a Wright-Fisher model with selection and
recombination.  We record these transmission events as *edges*, which we may describe as tuples `(left, right, parent,
child)`. In words, such a tuple means "Parental node label `parent` transmitted the genomic interval
:math:`[left,right)` to offspring node label `child`". 

The task of a forward simulation is to record new nodes and edges as they arise.  The simulation ends up recording many 
transmission events that quickly go extinct.  The simplification algorithm described in the 2018 paper mentioned above
takes this "messy" node and edge table and returns "simplified" node and edge tables.

We can visualize this process using an example taken from the `tskit` tutorials_, which implements the discrete-time
Wright-Fisher model for a diploid population without recombination and without selection:

.. ipython:: python

    import msprime
    import numpy as np

    def wf1(N, ngens):
        tc = msprime.TableCollection(1.0) 
        # Add 2N nodes at time = 0.
        # These nodes represent the 
        # initial list of parental
        # gametes
        for i in range(2*N):
            tc.nodes.add_row(time=0, flags=msprime.NODE_IS_SAMPLE)
        next_offspring_index = len(tc.nodes)
        first_parental_index = 0
        for gen in range(1,ngens+1):
            assert next_offspring_index == len(tc.nodes)
            assert first_parental_index == len(tc.nodes) - 2*N
            # Pick 2N parents
            parents = np.random.randint(0, N, 2*N)
            for parent1, parent2 in zip(parents[::2], parents[1::2]):
                # Pick 1 gamete from each parent
                mendel = np.random.random_sample(2)
                g1 = first_parental_index + 2*parent1 + (mendel[0] < 0.5)
                g2 = first_parental_index + 2*parent2 + (mendel[1] < 0.5)
                # Add nodes for our offspring's
                # two gametes
                tc.nodes.add_row(time=gen, flags=msprime.NODE_IS_SAMPLE)
                tc.nodes.add_row(time=gen, flags=msprime.NODE_IS_SAMPLE)
                # Add edges reflecting the
                # transmission from parental
                # nodes to offspring nodes
                tc.edges.add_row(left=0.0, right=1.0, parent=g1, child=next_offspring_index)
                tc.edges.add_row(left=0.0, right=1.0, parent=g2, child=next_offspring_index+1)
                next_offspring_index += 2
            first_parental_index += 2*N
        return tc


Let's run the simulation for a few generations and look at the resulting tree:

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:

    np.random.seed(42)
    tc = wf1(3, 4)
    # Before we can get a tree sequence from
    # the data, we must change direction of 
    # time from foward to backwards to satisty
    # msprime:
    t = tc.nodes.time
    t -= tc.nodes.time.max()
    t *= -1.0
    tc.nodes.set_columns(time=t, flags=tc.nodes.flags)
    # Sort the tables:
    tc.sort()
    ts = tc.tree_sequence()
    print(ts.first().draw(format="unicode"))


The resulting tree contains information for extinct lineages as well as redundant node information.  Note
that the three diploids in the last generation are defined by node pairs `(24,25)`, `(26,27)`, and `(28,29)`.

Let's apply the simplification algorithm that:

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:

    samples = np.where(tc.nodes.time == 0)[0]
    node_map = tc.simplify(samples=samples.tolist())
    ts = tc.tree_sequence()
    tree = ts.first()
    imap = {node_map[node]: node for node in range(len(node_map))}
    nl = {i:"{}->{}".format(imap[i],i) for i in tree.nodes()}
    print(tree.draw(format="unicode",node_labels=nl))

That's much nicer!  The simplified tree shows now the *input* node ids are remapped to *output* node ids
in such a manner that relative ordering is preserved.
 
Thus, the most pratical view of TSR is this: we speed up the simulations by *not* simulating neutral mutations.
We only have to simulate the selected variants and occasionally simplify our messy trees.  The realized speedups are
huge, and I refer you to the 2018 paper for the data on that.  But our simulations are not only faster.  They record
much more information.  The tables of nodes, edges, etc., record the entire history of the simulation with respect to a
set of sample nodes.

Anyone interested in some of the more technical details of implementing TSR can take a look at the tutorials_ accompanying the 2018 paper.
