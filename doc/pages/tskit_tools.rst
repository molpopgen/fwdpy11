    :members:

    The following are boolean flags that are used to populate
    :attr:`tskit.IndividualTable.flags`. The flags represent
    individuals alive at the end of the simulation, those
    preserved as ancient samples, and those from the 
    very first generation of the simulation, respectively.
    See :ref:`here <recapitation>` for why the last class
    of preserved samples are special.
