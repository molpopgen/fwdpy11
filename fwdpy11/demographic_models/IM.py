    Isolation-with-migration (IM) model for two demes.

    An ancestral population splits into two daughter demes.
    At the time of the split, ``psplit`` of the ancestral
    population moves into deme 1.  The two daughter populations
    begin exponential growth until the present time and migration
    may occur between them.

    :param Nanc: The ancestral population size.
    :type Nanc: int
    :param T: The time of the split, in units of Nanc generations
              into the past.
    :type T: float
    :param psplit: The proportion of the ancestral population that splits
                   off to found deme 1
    :type psplit: float
    :param Ns: The final sizes of demes 0 and 1, relative to Nanc
    :type Ns: tuple
    :param migrates: The migration rates from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0,
                     respectively. Migration rates are the fraction
                     of the destination deme replaced by the source
                     deme.
    :type migrates: float
    :param burnin: Time to simulate before the split, in units of Nanc
    :type burnin: float
    :param as_dict: If False, return an instance of
                    :class:`fwdpy11.DiscreteDemography`.
                    Otherwise, return a dict that can be
                    used to construct a ``DiscreteDemography``
                    instance.
    :type as_dict: boolean
    :rtype: tuple
    :returns: the model events, the split time, and
              the time to simulate post-split.

    .. note::

        The events returned by this model assume/require that you will
        construct a population with intitial size ``Nanc``.
