        When passing in extra args, they must be the following:

            In general, initializing a population using
            the output from a coalescent simulation is
            a tricky business.  There are issues of
            parameter scaling and the appropriateness
            of the coalescent model itself. A key issue
            is that your input tree sequence must have
            node times in the correct time units! (Generations,
            for example.) See :ref:`ts` for more discussion
