    "## Dealing with `GSL` errors in custom C++ code\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GSL` uses C-like error handling.  Here, this means that there is a global error handling function\n",
    "that will print the error to screen and then abort the running process.  The behavior of abort-on-error is not\n",
    "acceptable here, as the Python session itself will abort!\n",
    "\n",
    "When `fwdpy11` is imported, the default `GSL` behavior changes.  Instead of aborting, a `RuntimeError` will be raised.\n",
    "This exception will contain the entire string of text from the `GSL` error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you write and C++ code using the `GSL`, you may wish to handle errors locally and maybe return `None` or throw\n",
    "an exception with your own message in it.  To do so, you must do the following in your C++ code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Temporarily disable `GSL` error handling.\n",
    "2. Restore the `fwdpy11` error handler at all possible exit paths from your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "On paper, one could do all of the above using the C API found in the `GSL`.  However, `fwdpy11` provides a class that\n",
    "provides an idiomatic C++ approach to managing the error handler.  The C++ class `fwdpy11::gsl_error_handler_wrapper`,\n",
    "defined in `<fwdpy11/gsl/gsl_error_handler_wrapper.hpp>` provide a \"smart pointer\"-like wrapper around the error\n",
    "handler. The constructor disables the error handler, storing the value of the disabled handler.  The destructor restores\n",
    "the handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this in action, check out the unit test file `tests/test_GSLerror.py` and its associated C++ file\n",
    "`tests/gsl_error.cc`."
