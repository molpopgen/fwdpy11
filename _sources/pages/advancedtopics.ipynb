    "You have many options when it comes to running many replicates of a model.\n",
    "For example, you could write a single Python script plus a shell script\n",
    "that your local cluster understands, sending your simulation to hundreds\n",
    "of compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces {mod}`concurrent.futures` as a method to execute\n",

    "\n",
    "* The function to run the simulation typically does not return\n",
    "  the instance of {class}`fwdpy11.DiploidPopulation`.  Such\n",
    "  a return requires pickling, which is very expensive.  If you\n",
    "  need to store these population, write them to files rather\n",
    "  than returning them.\n",

    "## How long to run the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding how long to run a simulation depends on whether or not\n",
    "a \"burn in\" phase is required to get the model to statistical\n",
    "equilibrium.  For example, if you want to get the steady-state\n",
    "properties of a model with many selected mutations and linkage,\n",
    "you will need to burn in.  If you want to know how the short term\n",
    "dynamics of the neutral site-frequency spectrum are affected by suddenly\n",
    "introducing strongly-beneficial mutations, then you may not need to\n",
    "burn in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, then, how long to burn in?  Clearly, the answer should be \"the\n",
    "least that you have to\"!  As always, there are a few different\n",
    "things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want the *distribution* of final outcomes to be \"correct\".\n",
    "  Theory often gives us expressions for expectations and\n",
    "  sometimes for variances of things we care about, like\n",
    "  the number of mutations in a sample. However, comparing\n",
    "  distributions will often require a statistical analysis\n",
    "  comparing the output of independent simulations.\n",
    "  For example, for a neutral model, the distribution of the\n",
    "  number of mutations under an infinitely-many sites model\n",
    "  for a small sample should match `msprime` very well.\n",
    "  For a steady-state model of recurrent hitch-hiking\n",
    "  {cite}`Kaplan1989-rt`, results from small samples\n",
    "  should match coalescent simulations such as {cite}`Kern2016-wg`.\n",
    "  Clearly, all of the different methods\n",
    "  should match analytical results where possible.\n",
    "* You probably want all of your trees to be fully coalesced\n",
    "  to a single common ancestor.  The time back to a final\n",
    "  ancestor has a very long tail.  In models with recombination,\n",
    "  it is not uncommon to have a tree or three with multiple roots\n",
    "  at the end of a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first point, a burn-in of `10N` generations or so\n",
    "is usually sufficient. Before we simulated with tree sequence\n",
    "recording, we simulated entire \"genomes\" (neutral mutations and all),\n",
    "which was rather slow.  (Here \"we\" is the field in general.)  We then\n",
    "(hopefully!) compared our results to something like `msprime`.  The\n",
    "agreement was really good, so one answer is \"about `10N`.  I'm being\n",
    "vague about `N` here--typically, it would be equal to the starting effective\n",
    "population size of your population (*e.g.* in the absence of selection).\n",
    "\n",
    "With tree sequence recording, we run into the \"uncoalesced marginal\n",
    "trees\" issue mentioned above.  We could just simulate much longer\n",
    "to get rid of this problem, but it is simply easier to start\n",

    "#### Abstract base classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In object oriented lingo, the `fwdpy11` base classes here are *abstract\n",
    "base classes* or `ABCs`.  This means that they simply describe a required\n",
    "interface.  When you inherit from an ABC, you must fill in the details\n",
    "of that interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initializing the super class\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing object-oriented code, it is important that a derived\n",
    "class properly initialize the base class.  In Python, base\n",
    "classes are often called `superclasses` and derived classes are\n",
    "`subclasses`.\n",
    "\n",
